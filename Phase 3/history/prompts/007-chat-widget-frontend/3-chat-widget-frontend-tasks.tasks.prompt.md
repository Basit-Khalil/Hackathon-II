## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive task breakdown for the Chat Widget Frontend feature. The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1-P3) following the specification requirements. Phase 1 covers setup, Phase 2 foundational infrastructure, Phase 3 implements the core chat widget display functionality (P1), Phase 4 implements AI backend integration (P2), Phase 5 adds conversation continuity and error handling (P3), and Phase 6 includes polish and verification. Each phase includes checkpoints to validate functionality independently.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed task breakdown for Chat Widget Frontend implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive task list
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation of tasks using Claude Code
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-structured for parallel execution and independent validation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): initial tasks breakdown
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start implementing tasks beginning with Phase 1
