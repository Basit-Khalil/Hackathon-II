## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for UI/UX design implementation with tasks organized by user stories, dependencies, and parallelization opportunities. Created complete implementation plan with setup, foundational work, and user story-specific tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created for UI/UX design implementation following the spec-driven development approach
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks include validation of design system compliance, accessibility guidelines, and UI/UX specifications
- 📁 Files: Created comprehensive task list in tasks.md with all required implementation steps organized by user stories
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task execution following the structured implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are properly organized by user stories with clear dependencies and parallelization opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks command
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing tasks in sequential order starting with setup phase
