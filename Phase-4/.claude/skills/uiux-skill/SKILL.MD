   - Support light and dark themes if required

2. **Typography**
   - Use consistent font families, sizes, and weights
   - Maintain proper line-height and spacing
   - Apply headings, body, and captions consistently
   - Ensure readability across devices

3. **Spacing & Layout**
   - Apply consistent margins and paddings
   - Maintain grid or flexbox alignment
   - Use consistent spacing between components
   - Keep responsive layout for all screen sizes

4. **Styling & Visual Elements**
   - Apply borders, shadows, and backgrounds where appropriate
   - Create interactive effects (hover, focus, click)
   - Use rounded corners, transitions, and elevation subtly
   - Maintain visual hierarchy and emphasis on important elements

5. **Components & Patterns**
   - Design reusable UI components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
   - Maintain consistency across pages/screens
   - Follow UX principles for intuitive user flow
   - Avoid clutter and ensure simplicity

6. **Accessibility**
