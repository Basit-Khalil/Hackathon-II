# Frontend Skill

## Instructions
Implement frontend functionality with the following responsibilities:

1. **Page Development**
   - Build complete pages based on wireframes or specs
   - Ensure pages are responsive across devices
   - Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
   - Integrate necessary data from backend or APIs

2. **Component Creation**
   - Create reusable UI components
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Accept configurable props for flexibility
   - Ensure components are testable and modular

3. **Layout Management**
   - Structure layouts using grids or flexbox
   - Maintain consistent spacing, alignment, and hierarchy
   - Support nested components without breaking layouts
   - Implement global layout patterns (e.g., headers, footers, sidebars)

4. **Styling**
   - Use CSS, CSS-in-JS, or frameworks (Tailwind, Chakra, etc.)
   - Apply responsive design principles
   - Implement hover, focus, and animation effects
   - Follow color, typography, and branding guidelines
   - Ensure theme support (light/dark mode if needed)

5. **Best Practices**
   - Keep components small and single-responsibility
   - Avoid inline styling where possible
   - Maintain consistent naming and folder structure
   - Use proper accessibility attributes
   - Optimize images and assets for performance

## Example Page Flow (Pseudo)

User navigates → Page loads → Components render → Data fetched → Page fully interactive
